Milestone Objectives:
Analyze a problem space and include 1) who the various categories of users are, 2) why the problem is important, and 3) what existing solutions exist for this problem
The key goal of this milestone is to demonstrate a deeply understanding of the problem you are addressing.   That is, what is the problem, who are the relevant users, 
and what are the issues and constraints involved with the project. Your goal is to identify the important aspects of the problem domain that will influence your 
UI design for the rest of the project.

If the problem domain has an existing system or interface, you should perform an evaluation of that system to help you learn more about it.    You can learn a lot about 
something by examining existing solutions and their strengths and weaknesses.

In class we will discuss different techniques for acquiring of information. Feel free to utilize the techniques that you feel are most appropriate to the particular 
task you are examining. You must demonstrate, however, that you have extensively explored the problem area—show me the data! If I get the sense that minimal time was 
invested and/or obvious areas were not explored, you will not receive a good grade on this milestone.

Specific questions you need to thoroughly answer include:

- Who are the potential stakeholders?  Note, if your categories are sufficiently vague (e.g., "Students" are a stakeholder---think about how wide-ranging students 
  are as a category), you will likely not receive full points on your milestone).
- What tasks do they seek to perform?
- What functionality should the “system” provide? (Note, “system” does not necessarily mean a digital system—there may be analog solutions already in use. 
  For instance, a paper-based “to-do” list is an analog solution to keeping track of daily tasks.)
- What criteria should be used to judge if your design is a success or not? 

For full credit, you must provide the following information in your report.
* An overview of what the problem is and what are existing solutions, both analog and digital.
  - Do not propose a solution that’s in search of a problem!
* A description of the important characteristics of the users in the problem space.
* A task analysis consisting of:
* A description of the important characteristics of the tasks performed by users.
* A description of important characteristics of the task environment.
* A simple structured task analysis of the problem in one of the forms described in the textbook.
* An interpretive evaluation (e.g., heuristic evaluation, walkthrough, etc.) of the existing system/interface, if one exists.
* A brief description and justification of how the above information was gathered.
* Evidence that you have searched through scholarly articles to see if this problem space has been explored (you should research using the ACM 
  Digital Library, available through Clemson’s library).
* Finally, you need to synthesize your data and discuss what it implies for moving forward.  For instance, does your analysis indicate that designing 
  an application on a mobile device would be ideal for solving this problem?
  
Sage Advice:

The following are things to avoid doing (unless you want to not receive full credit!):
- Hand in a laundry list that describes target users, environment, and tasks (but you do need this information!)  You are showing how your milestone 
  findings are going to influence the design of your system moving forward.
- Over generalize stakeholders to where you won't have useful information.  
- Not find an obvious solution that already exists to the problem.
- Choosing a narrow problem space that doesn't yield rich exploration (hint: chat with Dr. Plaue during office hours before finalizing a problem space!)
- Not including a synthesis of why the problem matters and how impactful it can be.
