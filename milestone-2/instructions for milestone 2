Milestone Objectives:
Develop and apply creative and interpersonal skills in coming up with unique solutions to the problem defined in Milestone 1.
Your mission for this milestone is to take the information from:
•    The data acquired from milestone 1 (and your tentative design requirements)
•    Assigned readings (and if necessary, from relevant readings that have yet to be assigned)

and develop a series of three substantially different design alternatives for your problem.  At this stage, you are exploring the potential 
design space for a solution to the problem that you defined.  You must work with your team—do not split up and have each individual person 
create one design because that is not how strong creative processes work, as you’ll see from the class lecture on IDEO’s creative design strategies.
In class, I will introduce you to guiding principles to help make your creative sessions productive and rewarding.  In short, you will have 
brainstorming-like sessions with all team members present and aim to come up with fundamentally different solutions that are all over the design 
space for the problem you chose, of which you will choose the top three ideas to submit for this milestone.

To clarify, you'll need to come up with at least three drastically different design alternatives—that is, do not turn in three variations of a Web page.
To think of different design alternatives, think of things like different modalities (e.g., a kiosk vs mobile app), or reflect upon the environment (e.g., 
intended on being used while seated at a computer with multiple monitors versus using a handheld device)  and context of the tasks that users with to perform 
(e.g., is someone in a rush to complete the tasks versus does the user have dedicated time on his/her schedule to complete the task?.

Deliverable:
• For each of your three design alternatives, you will develop mockups, storyboards, and/or sketches that illustrate the use of the interactive interface at various stages.
  - Your materials should contain enough information (e.g., labels or text) that provide enough context that a potential user could give you feedback on the design.  
• Each design must have a detailed narrative for how someone would use the interactive system.
• Justifications for how and why design decisions were made (which should tie back to data that you discovered during Milestone 1).
• Lists of strengths and weaknesses of each design.

Submission Instructions
•    Upload the PDF of the document in the group dropbox on Canvas
•    Link your PDF on your group's web space
•    Studio 2 will be on 2/23/24 (which is the Friday after an exam on Wednesday, so plan accordingly!)

Tentative Grading Criteria
• Professionalism (proper grammar, spelling, title page with team identifier and name, page numbers, etc).
• Detail level of the narrative
• Supporting image details/relevance (e.g., do you have visuals to explain all aspects of how a user would accomplish tasks)
• Justifications for design decisions (e.g., explaining why these are the three best ideas (might need to give one or two of the non-selected ideas for comparison, if appropriate.))
• Detail level of the strength/weaknesses of each design (e.g., are you missing any obvious strengths or weaknesses).
